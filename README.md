# Welcome to SolPred
The name derived from the word "Solubility" and "Prediction"

## It is a web app to predict the solubility of molecules using machine learning models.
### EASY TO USE JUST SMILE :)
## How to use it?
First open the sidebar from the left side by clicking on the small arrow at the top of the page then you will be able to:

1. Enter the SMILES string of the molecule in the text input in the sidebar then click on the "Predict" button. There is a molecule already entered as an example.
2. You can also upload a CSV file containing the SMILES strings of the molecules in a column named "SMILES".
3. You can also view the 3D structure of the molecule by clicking on the "Show 3D structure" button in the sidebar.


## Model Training
The model was trained over 10397 unique compounds and it has the accuracy of R^2 equals 0.775817, MAE equals 0.731621 and RMSD equals 1.094537.

Enjoy using the app and don't forget to share it with your friends and colleagues
